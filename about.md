**10** years of experience leading actionable and timely  research via a hands-on data informed approach, and improve the lives of end-users. 

### Experience
#### Senior UX Manager: Research & Design, Docker, San Francisco, CA 				              07/2017 - present
Consolidated Docker's Enterprise product design by creating both generative and summative research practices to guide designers for two core products: Universal Control Plane (UCP), Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). 

#### UX Manager: Research & Design, Cloudera, Palo Alto, CA 	            10/2015 - 07/2017
Scaled Enterprise product design and research to build a team of designers and researchers for six core Cloudera products as we optimized for an Initial Public Offering event in 2017. I launched UX research and crafted a 18 month research strategy to unify and improve the end-to-end experience for our customers; this included creating a foundation for a lean hypothesis-driven customer-centric iterative design process. 

#### Lead User Experience Researcher, Platfora (acquired by Workday), San Mateo, CA          	             11/2013 - 10/2015
As one of the first hires at this startup, I led UX research to manage a rapid and iterative testing and evaluation for the leading platform in big data analytics.  My projects helped Product/Development to leverage key KPIs such as System Usability Scores, HEART metrics, etc. to gain timely insights for progressively improving the user-experience. I mentored two UX designers, two UX researchers, and three interns. I published three refereed articles at ACM CHI based on collaborative UX research projects in 2014 and 2015. 

#### Senior User Experience Researcher, RightScale, Santa Barbara, CA                             	01/2012 - 11/2013
Managed UX research that provided actionable product insights for one of the main cloud computing management platforms. In this classic fast paced startup, I also helped product managers to incorporate extensive user feedback into the Agile development cycles and product roadmaps.

#### Computer Scientist, Starkey Hearing Research Center, Berkeley, CA             	01/2008 - 1/2012
As the first HCI researcher at Starkey, I worked with hearing researchers and product developers to craft hearing aid user interfaces. To do this, I established the organization's first UX research strategy, incorporating traditional and novel methods to focus on business needs and provide actionable insights. This strategy included card sorting, prototyping, site visits, contextual inquiry, crowd-sourcing and brain-computer interfaces.

#### Research Assistant, Evolutionary Computing Systems Lab, University of Nevada, Reno, NV      	08/2003 - 05/2008
I architected a machine-learning framework to personalize desktop applications. My research aimed to optimize interruptions to users by harnessing both internal and external contextual information from a user's environment to predict her preferred application actions.
